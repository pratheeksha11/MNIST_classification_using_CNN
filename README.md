# MNIST Classification using CNN

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the classification of handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It leverages the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

## Data

The project uses two main data files:
- `train.csv`: This file contains the training data, with each row representing a labeled image of a handwritten digit.
- `test.csv`: This file consists of test data used to evaluate the performance of the CNN model.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) by training a CNN model on the MNIST dataset. The trained model will be able to predict the digit represented in each image from the test dataset.

## How to Use

To use this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Run the script to train the CNN on the `train.csv` data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the `test.csv` data.
